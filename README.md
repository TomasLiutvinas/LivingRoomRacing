# Living Room Racing
Site to display sim racing results. Previously been using Google Sheets for data source, but Google deprecated the JSON api.

This is the revived version using hardcoded json file as data source, I would prefer to rebuild this with react entirely.

There was live race/rounds standings, but that part is not revived yet.
